# Michael Forsythe Robinson
**AI Systems Architect & Marketing Science Engineer**

I build production-grade AI systems that generate measurable revenue and withstand epistemic scrutiny. Not prototypes. Not correlation theater. Real causal inference infrastructure at scale.

        ## 🎯 What I Ship

        ### **Attribution Science & Causal Inference**
        Most "attribution" is just weighted correlation with extra steps. I build systems grounded in **first-principles causal frameworks**:

        - **Markov chain state modeling** for temporal causality (not just last-touch heuristics)
        - - **Shapley value decomposition** for fair marginal contribution (game-theoretic fairness)
          - - **Bayesian uncertainty quantification** to bound epistemic vs. aleatoric error
            - - **Real-time probabilistic identity resolution** for streaming platforms (Kafka + Ray)
              -
              - **Why this matters:** Resolves the fundamental gap between "correlation that shipped" and "causation that scales."
              -
              - ### **Production ML Infrastructure**
              - End-to-end data engineering for AI systems that don't explode in production:
              -
              - - **Event streaming pipelines:** Apache Kafka, Delta Lake, CDC (change data capture)
                - - **Distributed compute:** Ray, Dask, orchestration with Airflow/Prefect
                  - - **Feature stores & versioning:** MLflow, DVC for reproducible experiments
                    - - **Observability:** Prometheus, Grafana, custom drift detection (Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests)
                      -
                      - **Recent case:** Live event attribution engine for WWE Raw on Netflix—second-screen correlation with <2s latency during live broadcasts.
                      -
                      - ### **Marketing Science & Growth Systems**
                      - Behavioral profiling, audience segmentation, and revenue optimization:
                      -
                      - - **Psychographic priors** for context-aware attribution (not just demographics)
                        - - **Treatment effect heterogeneity** to identify high-value segments (CATE estimation)
                          - - **Multi-armed bandit** optimization for dynamic creative allocation
                            - - **LLM-augmented research:** Automated product discovery (2.6 sale-ready products/day, zero manual work)
