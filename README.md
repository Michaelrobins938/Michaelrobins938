### Attribution Science & Causal Inference
Most "attribution" is just weighted correlation with extra steps. I build systems grounded in **first-principles causal frameworks**:

- **Markov chain state modeling** for temporal causality (not just last-touch heuristics)
- **Shapley value decomposition** for fair marginal contribution (game-theoretic fairness)
- **Bayesian uncertainty quantification** to bound epistemic vs. aleatoric error
- **Real-time probabilistic identity resolution** for streaming platforms (Kafka + Ray)

**Why this matters:** Resolves the fundamental gap between "correlation that shipped" and "causation that scales."

style E fill:#fbb,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

**Key Components:**
- **Kafka**: Ingests 10K+ events/sec from web, mobile, server-side
- **Delta Lake**: Versioned feature store with time-travel for reproducibility
- **Attribution Engine**: First-principles causal framework (not weighted correlation)
- **Bayesian UQ**: Quantifies model uncertainty, prevents overconfident predictions
- **API Layer**: Sub-100ms latency for real-time decisioning

</details>

### Production ML Infrastructure
End-to-end data engineering for AI systems that don't explode in production:

- **Event streaming pipelines:** Apache Kafka, Delta Lake, CDC (change data capture)
- **Distributed compute:** Ray, Dask, orchestration with Airflow/Prefect
- **Feature stores & versioning:** MLflow, DVC for reproducible experiments
- **Observability:** Prometheus, Grafana, custom drift detection (Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests)

**Recent case:** Live event attribution engine for WWE Raw on Netflix—second-screen correlation with <2s latency during live broadcasts.

### Marketing Science & Growth Systems
Behavioral profiling, audience segmentation, and revenue optimization:

- **Psychographic priors** for context-aware attribution (not just demographics)
- **Treatment effect heterogeneity** to identify high-value segments (CATE estimation)
- **Multi-armed bandit** optimization for dynamic creative allocation
- **LLM-augmented research:** Automated product discovery (2.6 sale-ready products/day, zero manual work)

--- Core Philosophy: The Principles of a Modern Polymath
The massive output of 2025 was not accidental; it was the direct result of a core set of repeatable principles. These principles form the operating system for a new kind of creator—one who fluidly merges technical mastery with creative intuition, using each to inform and elevate the other. They are the intellectual framework that enabled the simultaneous development of production-grade software, published novels, and scalable business ventures.
1.1. Principle I: The Symbiosis of Art and Algorithm
The guiding philosophy is that creative and technical pursuits are not opposing forces but symbiotic partners. Creative endeavors, such as the drafting of the 60,000-word manuscript mentally ill but hot or the world-building for Aethoria: Convergence, inform logical problem-solving by cultivating empathy and non-linear thinking. Conversely, technical skills provide new mediums for artistic expression, as seen in the creation of over 966 individual art pieces and interactive digital tools. This feedback loop, where algorithms become a canvas and art becomes a system, is not merely a process but a strategic advantage that unlocks novel solutions unavailable to the single-domain specialist.
1.2. Principle II: AI as the Universal Amplifier
An "AI-First Development" approach is central to this entire body of work. Artificial intelligence is not viewed as a mere tool but as a collaborative partner that fundamentally amplifies productivity and creative potential. This principle is evidenced by the "500 AI Agents Platform," an ecosystem of 52 specialized agents powering 11 live SaaS products, and the mastery of over 15 distinct AI platforms, from Anthropic's Claude to NVIDIA's NitroGen foundation models. This deep integration reflects the core belief that AI enables a "10x developer," creating a competitive advantage in velocity and scale that is impossible to achieve through traditional means.

Principle III: Full-Stack Completeness and Shipping What You Start
There is a stark contrast between building prototypes and shipping production-ready systems. This principle embodies a relentless commitment to the latter, a "from idea to production" mindset that prioritizes tangible results. This is proven by the overhaul of the LitRPG Unlimited web platform, which involved a full migration to TypeScript and complex Stripe integration, the 11 live SaaS products, and the publication of the novel Aethoria: Convergence. This focus on completion is the mechanism that transforms intellectual assets into demonstrable, market-ready value.

2.1.2. Actionable Data Products: A system that generated 214,384 enriched leads with a 99.6% match rate.
The DFW Roofing Intelligence System turns raw public data into a high-value commercial asset. By integrating NOAA storm data with property records, the system demonstrates a proven 30x return on investment for clients.

 Principle IV: Data Sovereignty as a Moral Imperative
Taking ownership of one's digital life is not just a technical exercise but a moral one. This principle was put into practice through the methodical archiving and analysis of over 25 GB of personal data from platforms like Google and Facebook. The Attribution Mind Map project exemplifies this philosophy by transforming a decade of passive digital footprints into an interactive map of personal behavior. Asserting this control is more than an act of self-reflection; it is a foundational skill for building user-centric, ethical products in a data-driven world.

PhD-Level Data Science: A research-grade behavioral profiling system analyzing 11 years of temporal data.
The Attribution Mind Map employs advanced Markov-Shapley models and interactive 3D visualizations to map human behavior, showcasing deep mastery of complex data science and its application to personal insight.

 The Mission: Scale the Impact
If 2025 was about building the foundation, then 2026 is about scaling the impact. The groundwork has been laid, the skills have been proven, and the systems are in place. The mission for the coming year is to move from creation to deployment—to launch the products, publish the books, generate revenue, and begin building a lasting legacy at the intersection of artificial intelligence, psychology, and creative expression. The principles have been forged, the evidence has been built, and the creator has been transformed. All systems are operational.
"That's when we scale to the moon."
