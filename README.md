# Michael Forsythe Robinson
**AI Systems Architect & Marketing Science Engineer**

I build production AI systems that generate measurable revenue, not prototypes that gather dust.

## What I Ship

**Attribution & Marketing Science**  
First-principles attribution frameworks combining Markov chains (causality), Shapley values (fairness), and Bayesian uncertainty quantification. Real-time probabilistic identity resolution for streaming platforms (78% accuracy, <100ms latency, GDPR/CCPA compliant).

**Production ML Infrastructure**  
End-to-end data pipelines on Kafka, Delta Lake, and Ray. Behavioral profiling systems revealing 30% ROI improvement through treatment effect heterogeneity. Live event attribution engines for sports advertising with time-decay models.

**Recent Case Studies**
- Geospatial lead generation: 214,384 qualified leads, 99.6% accuracy
- - Contact rate optimization: 30% → 70% improvement
  - - Automated product research: 2.6 sale-ready products daily, zero manual work
