### Attribution Science & Causal Inference
Most "attribution" is just weighted correlation with extra steps. I build systems grounded in **first-principles causal frameworks**:

- **Markov chain state modeling** for temporal causality (not just last-touch heuristics)
- **Shapley value decomposition** for fair marginal contribution (game-theoretic fairness)
- **Bayesian uncertainty quantification** to bound epistemic vs. aleatoric error
- **Real-time probabilistic identity resolution** for streaming platforms (Kafka + Ray)

**Why this matters:** Resolves the fundamental gap between "correlation that shipped" and "causation that scales."

A[Event Stream<br/>Kafka] --> B[Feature Store<br/>Delta Lake]
B --> C[Attribution Engine<br/>Markov + Shapley]
C --> D[Bayesian UQ<br/>Confidence Bounds]
D --> E[API Layer<br/><100ms p99]
E --> F[Client Dashboard<br/>Real-time Insights]

style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px

style D fill:#bfb,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
style E fill:#fbb,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

**Key Components:**
- **Kafka**: Ingests 10K+ events/sec from web, mobile, server-side
- **Delta Lake**: Versioned feature store with time-travel for reproducibility
- **Attribution Engine**: First-principles causal framework (not weighted correlation)
- **Bayesian UQ**: Quantifies model uncertainty, prevents overconfident predictions
- **API Layer**: Sub-100ms latency for real-time decisioning

</details>

### Production ML Infrastructure
End-to-end data engineering for AI systems that don't explode in production:

- **Event streaming pipelines:** Apache Kafka, Delta Lake, CDC (change data capture)
- **Distributed compute:** Ray, Dask, orchestration with Airflow/Prefect
- **Feature stores & versioning:** MLflow, DVC for reproducible experiments
- **Observability:** Prometheus, Grafana, custom drift detection (Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests)

**Recent case:** Live event attribution engine for WWE Raw on Netflix—second-screen correlation with <2s latency during live broadcasts.

### Marketing Science & Growth Systems
Behavioral profiling, audience segmentation, and revenue optimization:

- **Psychographic priors** for context-aware attribution (not just demographics)
- **Treatment effect heterogeneity** to identify high-value segments (CATE estimation)
- **Multi-armed bandit** optimization for dynamic creative allocation
- **LLM-augmented research:** Automated product discovery (2.6 sale-ready products/day, zero manual work)

| **Product Research Automation** | E-commerce brand spent 8 hrs/day on manual product research | LLM-powered competitive analysis + trend detection; automated scoring | **2.6 products/day** flagged as sale-ready, **100%** automation |
| **Streaming Identity Resolution** | Ad platform needed real-time user matching across devices (GDPR-compliant) | Probabilistic graph matching with Bayesian priors; <100ms p99 latency | **78% accuracy** at scale, fully GDPR/CCPA compliant |
