## What I Ship

<img width="1376" height="768" alt="attribution architecture" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bcb5632a-4e6c-4dce-bab8-f18d9e4dee76" />

### Attribution Science & Causal Inference

Most “attribution” is just weighted correlation with extra steps. I build systems grounded in **first-principles causal frameworks**:[page:2]

- **Markov chain state modeling** for temporal causality, not last-touch heuristics[page:2]  
- **Shapley value decomposition** for fair marginal contribution using game-theoretic methods[page:2]  
- **Bayesian uncertainty quantification** to separate epistemic from aleatoric error[page:2]  
- **Real-time probabilistic identity resolution** for streaming platforms (Kafka + Ray)[page:2]  

**Why this matters:** It closes the gap between “correlation that shipped” and **causation that scales**.[page:2]

```

**Key components:** Kafka for 10K+ events/sec ingest, Delta Lake for versioned features, a Markov+Shapley attribution engine, Bayesian UQ for honest confidence, and a sub-100ms API layer for real-time decisioning.[page:2]

</details>

### Production ML Infrastructure

End-to-end data engineering for AI systems that don’t explode in production:[page:2]

- **Event streaming pipelines:** Apache Kafka, Delta Lake, CDC[page:2]  
- **Distributed compute:** Ray, Dask, orchestration with Airflow/Prefect[page:2]  
- **Feature stores & versioning:** MLflow, DVC for reproducible experiments[page:2]  
- **Observability:** Prometheus, Grafana, custom drift detection with statistical tests[page:2]  

**Recent case:** Live event attribution engine for WWE Raw on Netflix, delivering second-screen correlation with <2s latency during live broadcasts.[page:2]

### Marketing Science & Growth Systems

Behavioral profiling, audience segmentation, and revenue optimization:[page:2]

- **Psychographic priors** for context-aware attribution beyond basic demographics[page:2]  
- **Treatment effect heterogeneity** to surface high-value segments (CATE estimation)[page:2]  
- **Multi-armed bandit** optimization for dynamic creative allocation[page:2]  
- **LLM-augmented research** for automated product discovery (2.6 sale-ready products/day, zero manual work)[page:2]

## The 2025 Blueprint

### Core Philosophy: Modern Polymath

The output of 2025 came from a deliberate operating system: merge deep technical rigor, aggressive creativity, and commercialization into one continuous stack.[page:2] That stack shipped production SaaS, published fiction, and scalable marketing engines instead of isolated side projects.[page:2]

### Principle I: Symbiosis of Art and Algorithm

Creative work like *mentally ill but hot* and the Aethoria universe sharpened empathy, narrative, and non-linear thinking that feed directly into system design.[page:2] In return, technical systems—966+ art pieces, interactive tools, and AI consoles—became canvases where algorithms and aesthetics are fused on purpose.[page:2]

### Principle II: AI as the Universal Amplifier

An **AI-first** approach runs through everything: the “500 AI Agents Platform” (52 agents powering 11 SaaS products) and fluency across 15+ AI platforms show applied 10x leverage.[page:2] AI functions as a collaborator here, collapsing iteration cycles and unlocking scope unreachable by a solo human.[page:2]

### Principle III: Full-Stack Completeness

The bar is “from idea to production,” not “interesting demo.”[page:2] That showed up in the LitRPG Unlimited TypeScript + Stripe overhaul, 11 live SaaS products, and a published novel—all built as finished, monetizable assets.[page:2]

### Principle IV: Data Sovereignty

Owning and interrogating 25+ GB of personal exhaust from Google, Facebook, and more turned passive data into an Attribution Mind Map of real behavior.[page:2] The same philosophy underpins how user-centric, ethical products are designed going forward.[page:2]

### Principle V: Ethical Engineering

Projects like Lightwell JAMI-3, an AI therapy system grounded in clinical psychology and guardrails, encode ethics as a core requirement, not a marketing slide.[page:2] Sensitive AI domains are treated with stricter standards and explicit safeguards.[page:2]

---

## Evidence From the Forge

### Engineered Intelligence

You built and deployed systems like the 11-product SaaS ecosystem, the 214,384-lead DFW Roofing Intelligence engine, and JARVIS, a local, persistent personal AI layer.[page:2] The Attribution Mind Map pushed into research-grade behavioral profiling over 11 years of temporal data.[page:2]

### Weaving Worlds

In parallel, you shipped *Aethoria: Convergence* to Kindle, finished *mentally ill but hot*, created 966+ art pieces, and automated a print-on-demand Shopify store end-to-end.[page:2] The Aethoria Console turned that IP into an AI-powered, interactive RPG experience.[page:2]

### Building Ecosystems

On the commercial side, Forsythe Publishing & Marketing targets local dominance with AI-driven lead follow-up, while LitRPG Unlimited demonstrates full-stack product ownership from codebase to payments.[page:2] Together, these ecosystems turn creative and technical assets into durable revenue engines.[page:2]

---

## The Mission: Scale the Impact

If 2025 was about building the foundation, 2026 is about scaling the impact.[page:2] The goal now is to move from creation to deployment—launch products, publish books, generate revenue, and build a lasting legacy at the intersection of AI, psychology, and creative expression.[page:2]

> All systems are operational. That’s when we scale to the moon.[page:2]
